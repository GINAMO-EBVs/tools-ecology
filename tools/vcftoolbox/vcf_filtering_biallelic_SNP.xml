Usage
=====
As input, the user provides one or more VCF files (Danecek *et al.* 2011).

For each input VCF file, the tool identifies the number of alleles for each variant and removes all loci that do not possess exactly two alleles (the reference and one alternative allele) in the output file.

Example : if a variant is monomorphic (only reference) or has more than one alternative allele, it is discarded from the output VCF file.

They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods.The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines.Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed \\&gt;1 million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available from https://www.htslib.org.}",
